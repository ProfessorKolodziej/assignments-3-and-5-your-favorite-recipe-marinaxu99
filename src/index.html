	<p>This Creamy Tomato Soup is easy, comforting, and has a rich flavor profile. Watch the easy video tutorial and
		you’ll be craving a bowl of tomato soup paired with a gooey <a

	<p>You can make this tomato soup creamy or chunky if you prefer, but we love creamy soup recipes from <a
			href="https://natashaskitchen.com/creamy-sweet-potato-coconut-soup-recipe/">Creamy Sweet
			Potato Soup</a> to our velvety <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/carrot-soup/">Carrot Soup</a> and
		definitely <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/potato-soup/">Creamy Potato Soup</a>.</p>
	<p>My husband never loved tomato soup until he tried this Creamy Tomato Soup. The addition of parmesan and just 1/2
		cup of cream makes it so satisfying. It’s also a quick and easy 30-minute soup that keeps well in the fridge. We
		love it all year round and whip up a batch any time we are craving <a
			href="https://natashaskitchen.com/grilled-cheese-sandwich/">Grilled Cheese Sandwiches</a>.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<p>Since this is a tomato-based soup, it is important to offset the acidity with some key ingredients. We use a
		combination of cream, parmesan, and a little sugar to balance the soup.</p>
	<img src="images/2.jpg" />
	<ul>
		<li>Butter – use unsalted butter to sautee onions
			Yellow onion – it seems like a ton of onion but it dissapears into the soup adding a balanced sweetness</li>
		<li>Garlic – you’ll need 1 Tbsp minced from about 3 cloves
			Crushed tomatoes – with their juice, preferably <a href="https://amzn.to/3yvSgLo">San Marzano tomatoes</a>
		</li>
		<li>Chicken stock – for the best flavor use homemade <a
				href="https://natashaskitchen.com/chicken-stock-chicken-bone-broth/">chicken broth</a></li>
		<li>Basil – chop and add 1/4 cup fresh basil, plus more to serve. Basil leaves are easily bruised so chop by
			stacking a bunch of leaves then roll them into a log and cut into thin strips.</li>
		<li>Sugar – It’s just 1 Tbsp, but necessary to combat the tomato acidity.</li>
		<li>Black pepper – start with 1/2 tsp and add more to taste. </li>
		<li>Whipping cream – adds a creaminess to the soup and offsets acidity.</li>
		<li>Parmesan cheese – adds saltiness to the soup and balances acidity. Adding parmesan adds enough salt and I
			usually don’t add more.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>How to Make Tomato Soup</h2>
	<img src="images/3.jpg" />
	<ol>
		<li>Saute Aromatics – heat a non-reactive pot over medium heat. Melt in 4 Tbsp butter then sautee onions until
			softened and golden (10-12 min). Add minced garlic and saute another minute.</li>
		<li>Make the tomato soup base – stir in two 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes with their juice, your chicken stock,
			chopped basil, sugar and black pepper. Bring to a boil then reduce heat, partially cover and simmer 10
			minutes.</li>
		<li>Blend if desired – use an <a href="https://amzn.to/3yAmZHe">immersion blender</a> in the pot or blend in
			batches using a <a href="https://amzn.to/2XZ52ms">blender</a> (be careful not
			to overfill the blender with hot liquid) and return soup to the pot.</li>
		<li>Add cream and parmesan – stir in the heavy cream and shredded parmesan. Return to a simmer and season to
			taste if needed.</li>
		<li>Serve – ladle into warm bowls and garnish with more parmesan and basil.</li>
	</ol>

	<aside class="tip">
		<p>Pro Tip: If you prefer a chunky soup with bits of tomato (like our <a
				href="https://natashaskitchen.com/broccoli-cheese-soup/">Broccoli Cheese Soup</a>), you can skip the
			blending step and proceed with adding cream and parmesan then season to taste.</p>
	</aside>
	<h2>Important: Use a Non-Reactive Pot</h2>
	<p>Since this soup is tomato-based it is important to use a non-reactive pot. Avoid aluminum, cast iron, and copper
		which are all made of metals that can react with tomatoes and make the soup taste metallic.</p>
	<p>Non-reactive pots that work well include: Stainless steel, enamel-coated cast iron, ceramic, and glass. We used
		our <a href="https://amzn.to/3CmSExS">5 1/2 Qt enamel-coated dutch oven pot</a>.</p>
	<h2>How to Serve Tomato Soup</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Grilled Cheese – tomato soup and <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/grilled-cheese-sandwich/">grilled
				cheese sandwiches</a> are the perfect match (try dipping the sandwich
			into the soup).</li>
		<li>Parmesan – add shredded parmesan while the soup is hot so it melts over the top.</li>
		<li>Fresh Basil – sprinkle the top with thinly sliced basil.</li>
		<li><a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/easy-crunchy-garlic-croutons-recipe/">Croutons</a> – sprinkle crunchy
			croutons over the soup.</li>
		<li>Toast – simple toasted bread or crostini (like we made for <a
				href="https://natashaskitchen.com/classic-bruschetta-recipe/">Bruschetta</a>) are great for dunking into
			the soup.
		</li>
	</ul>

		<h2>Creamy Tomato Soup Recipe</h2>
		<p>Author: <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/natasha-kravchuk/">Natasha Kravchuk</a></p>
		<img src="images/5.jpg" />
		<p>Our go-to creamy tomato soup recipe. Adding parmesan and heavy cream makes it so satisfying and balances the
			acidity. It’s also a quick and easy 30-minute soup that keeps well in the fridge. We love this Tomato Basil
			Soup paired with <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/grilled-cheese-sandwich/">Grilled Cheese
				Sandwiches</a>.</p>
		<p>PREP: 5 MINS COOK: 25 MINS TOTAL: 30 MINS</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<p>Servings: 8 people (1 cup servings)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>4 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
			<li>2 yellow onions, (3 cups finely chopped)</li>
			<li>3 garlic cloves, (1 Tbsp minced)</li>
			<li>56 oz <a href="https://amzn.to/2Pz1Kkr">crushed tomatoes</a>, (two, 28-oz cans) with their juice,
				preferably San Marzano</li>
			<li>2 cups <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/chicken-stock-chicken-bone-broth/">chicken stock</a></li>
			<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil, plus more to serve</li>
			<li>1 Tbsp <a href="https://amzn.to/3XWoZsa">sugar</a>, or added to taste</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp black pepper, or to taste</li>
			<li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream, or to taste to combat acidity</li>
			<li>1/3 cup parmesan cheese, freshly grated, plus more to serve</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Heat a nonreactive pot or enameled dutch oven over medium heat. Add butter then add chopped onions.
				Sauté 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden. Add minced garlic and sauté 1
				minute until fragrant.</li>
			<li>Add crushed tomatoes with their juice, chicken stock, chopped basil, sugar (or add sugar to taste), and
				black pepper. Stir together and bring to a boil then reduce heat, partially cover with lid and simmer
				for 10 minutes.</li>
			<li>You can leave your soup with a chunky consistency, but if you like a blended/creamy soup, use an
				immersion blender to blend the soup in the pot to desired consistency or transfer to a blender in
				batches and blend until smooth (being careful not to over-fill the blender with hot liquid and pulse a
				few times initially to get it started), then return blended soup to the pot over medium heat.</li>
			<li>Add 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese and return to a simmer. Season to taste
				with salt and pepper if needed and turn off the heat.*</li>
			<li>Ladle into warm bowls and top with more parmesan and chopped fresh basil.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Notes</h3>
		<p>*Some crushed tomatoes can seem tangier. If the soup seems too acidic or sour, you can add more heavy cream
			and sugar to taste. </p>
