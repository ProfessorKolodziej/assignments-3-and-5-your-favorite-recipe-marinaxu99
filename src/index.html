			<p>This Creamy Tomato Soup is easy, comforting, and has a rich flavor profile. Watch the easy video tutorial
				and
				you’ll be craving a bowl of tomato soup paired with a gooey <a

			<p>You can make this tomato soup creamy or chunky if you prefer, but we love creamy soup recipes from <a
					href="https://natashaskitchen.com/creamy-sweet-potato-coconut-soup-recipe/">Creamy Sweet
					Potato Soup</a> to our velvety <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/carrot-soup/">Carrot Soup</a> and
				definitely <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/potato-soup/">Creamy Potato Soup</a>.</p>
			<p>My husband never loved tomato soup until he tried this Creamy Tomato Soup. The addition of parmesan and just
				1/2
				cup of cream makes it so satisfying. It’s also a quick and easy 30-minute soup that keeps well in the
				fridge.
				We
				love it all year round and whip up a batch any time we are craving <a

			<section class="what-is-in-it-content">
				<p>Since this is a tomato-based soup, it is important to offset the acidity with some key ingredients. We
					use a
					combination of cream, parmesan, and a little sugar to balance the soup.</p>
			</section>
			<img src="images/2.jpg"
				alt="Ingredients on a wooden surface: onions, mint, canned crushed tomatoes, chicken stock, cream, grated cheese, butter, and small bowls of salt and pepper." />
			<section class="what-is-in-it-list">
				<ul>
					<li><b>Butter</b> – use unsalted butter to sautee onions</li>
					<li><b>Yellow onion</b> – it seems like a ton of onion but it dissapears into the soup adding a balanced
						sweetness
					</li>
					<li><b>Garlic</b> – you’ll need 1 Tbsp minced from about 3 cloves
						Crushed tomatoes – with their juice, preferably <a href="https://amzn.to/3yvSgLo">San Marzano
							tomatoes</a>
					</li>
					<li><b>Chicken stock</b> – for the best flavor use homemade <a
							href="https://natashaskitchen.com/chicken-stock-chicken-bone-broth/">chicken broth</a></li>
					<li><b>Basil</b> – chop and add 1/4 cup fresh basil, plus more to serve. Basil leaves are easily bruised
						so chop
						by
						stacking a bunch of leaves then roll them into a log and cut into thin strips.</li>
					<li><b>Sugar</b> – It’s just 1 Tbsp, but necessary to combat the tomato acidity.</li>
					<li><b>Black pepper</b> – start with 1/2 tsp and add more to taste. </li>
					<li><b>Whipping cream</b> – adds a creaminess to the soup and offsets acidity.</li>
					<li><b>Parmesan cheese</b> – adds saltiness to the soup and balances acidity. Adding parmesan adds enough
						salt
						and
						I
						usually don’t add more.</li>

				<ol>
					<li>Saute Aromatics – heat a non-reactive pot over medium heat. Melt in 4 Tbsp butter then sautee onions
						until
						softened and golden (10-12 min). Add minced garlic and saute another minute.</li>
					<li>Make the tomato soup base – stir in two 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes with their juice, your chicken
						stock,
						chopped basil, sugar and black pepper. Bring to a boil then reduce heat, partially cover and simmer 10
						minutes.</li>
					<li>Blend if desired – use an <a href="https://amzn.to/3yAmZHe">immersion blender</a> in the pot or blend
						in
						batches using a <a href="https://amzn.to/2XZ52ms">blender</a> (be careful not
						to overfill the blender with hot liquid) and return soup to the pot.</li>
					<li>Add cream and parmesan – stir in the heavy cream and shredded parmesan. Return to a simmer and season
						to
						taste if needed.</li>
					<li>Serve – ladle into warm bowls and garnish with more parmesan and basil.</li>

				<p>Pro Tip: If you prefer a chunky soup with bits of tomato (like our <a

			<h3 class="important-heading">Important: Use a Non-Reactive Pot</h3>
			<section class="important-content">
				<p>Since this soup is tomato-based it is important to use a non-reactive pot. Avoid aluminum, cast iron,
					and
					copper
					which are all made of metals that can react with tomatoes and make the soup taste metallic.</p>
				<p>Non-reactive pots that work well include: Stainless steel, enamel-coated cast iron, ceramic, and
					glass.
					We
					used
					our <a href="https://amzn.to/3CmSExS">5 1/2 Qt enamel-coated dutch oven pot</a>.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Grilled Cheese – tomato soup and <a

							cheese sandwiches</a> are the perfect match (try dipping the sandwich
						into the soup).</li>
					<li>Parmesan – add shredded parmesan while the soup is hot so it melts over the top.</li>
					<li>Fresh Basil – sprinkle the top with thinly sliced basil.</li>
					<li><a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/easy-crunchy-garlic-croutons-recipe/">Croutons</a> – sprinkle

					<li>Toast – simple toasted bread or crostini (like we made for <a

		<details class="common-questions">
			<summary>Common Questions</summary>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Can I substitute canned whole tomatoes?</b>
					<div>You can use canned whole peeled tomatoes, but crush them by pulsing in a food processor before
						adding to
						the pot. Be sure to season to taste if substituting.</div>
				</li>
				<li><b>Can I use dried basil?</b>
					<div>You can substitute the fresh basil with about 1 Tbsp of dried basil for the soup. I suggest adding
						dried
						basil when you add the crushed tomatoes to give them a chance to soften. Dried herbs work great in
						soups,
						but should not be used for garnish.</div>
				</li>
				<li><b>Can I use fresh tomatoes?</b>
					<div>You’ll need to make your own crushed tomatoes which can be a time-consuming process. We find it is
						much
						simpler to buy crushed tomatoes.</div>
				</li>
				<li><b>What stock do you use for tomato soup?</b>
					<div>We love chicken bone broth because it has a great depth of flavor, but you can substitute it with
						vegetable broth to keep this a vegetarian soup.</div>
				</li>
				<li><b>What if my soup is too sour or acidic?</b>
					<div>Make sure you aren’t using a reactive pot (see above) and add more sugar and cream to taste to
						balance the acidity.</div>

					<h3>Instructions</h3>
					<ol>

							few times initially to get it started), then return blended soup to the pot over medium heat.</li>
